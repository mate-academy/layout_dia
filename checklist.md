## HR review

1. To make it clear to the recruiter what exactly this landing page is, it is better to give the whole web page the title “Eco cosmetics”
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
3. Links in the header and footer menus should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
4. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
5. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
6. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
7. It would be more realistic if the "shopping cart" button was active and clickable
8. All the social icons in the footer should be clickable and open the social networks in a new tab
