## Technologies

  - An environment of node is utilized for devops.
  - Scss files are being used for creation of reusable BEM blocks.
  - Lint checkups for readability is implemented and tested for all of the scss, js and html code.

# Some Details
  - The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
  - Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
  - Everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
  - Added favicon for various device types
  - Smooth scroll for the whole page
  - For the preview, When you try to send the form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
  - The form doesnâ€™t submit empty
  - Hover effects on cards in the boundaries of all devices types.
  - Responsive menu for the header
