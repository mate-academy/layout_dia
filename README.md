# Info
1.The site has a bright and dynamic design. Thanks to the use of BEM - the navigation block is used in 2 places. The slider is made using jQuery. Worked on the architecture of the project. By using flexbox and media queries, I have achieved flexibility and adaptation to different screen sizes.
2.HTML5, CSS3, SASS(SCSS), jQuery - Used here;
