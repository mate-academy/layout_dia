# Dia landing page

## Short description:
A Page has a header, footer, and six sections. Includes carousel, "drop-down" menu, form to sending messages, and references to itself parts.
With technical side has semantic tags, a file with reset properties, inputs with types and requirements, and hover effects for all interacting elements.
The project has four screen extensions:
  - mobile (to 639px)
  - tablet (640-1023px);
  - small desktop (1024-1259px);
  - desktop (from 1260px).

## Extra technologies:
1) Sass with using:
  - a BEM;
  - variables;
  - mixins and medias (@mixin and @media);
  - loops (@for) to create a comfortable grid.
2) Short js-code that realizes:
  - improvement of the "drop-down" menu;
  - adding e.preventDefault() and form.reset() to form submit;
  - correct working of the "carousel".

## Figma design:
https://www.figma.com/file/7qwsWggv9BAxMi2VPhBuPr/Air-(formerly-Dia)?node-id=9138%3A35 - where the darck page was selected.

I didn't follow in only design point:
  - button "learn more" in "services" section has incorrect hover effect,beacouse in my opiinion user must have an hover effect not only on the button, but also on the text ("learn more").
