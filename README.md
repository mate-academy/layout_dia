## Introduction
Air is a modern and stylish landing page that represents a strategic agency specializing in innovative tech ideas and solutions.

## BEM methodology
BEM methodology: BEM helped me to write clean, modular, and maintainable CSS code. By following a consistent naming convention for my CSS classes, it was easier to understand the purpose of each style rule and to avoid specificity issues or conflicts with other styles.

## SAAS
Sass: Sass allowed me to write more powerful and flexible CSS by using variables, mixins, and placeholders. This made it easier to reuse common styles, reduce code duplication, and make changes quickly and consistently across the project.

## Anchors
Anchors: Anchors provided a smooth and convenient navigation experience for users, allowing them to quickly jump to different sections of the page without having to scroll manually. This can improve the overall user experience and engagement, especially for longer or more complex pages.

## Burger menu
Burger menu: The burger menu provided a clean and minimalist way to hide navigation items when they are not needed, reducing clutter and distractions on the page. It also allowed me to implement responsive design and adapt the layout to different screen sizes and devices.

## HTML form
HTML form: The HTML form allowed me to collect information from users and send it to a server for processing. This can be useful for various purposes, such as contact forms, user registrations, or surveys.

## Grid
Display grid: Display grid provided a powerful and flexible layout system, allowing me to create complex grid structures with relative ease. This made it easier to align and position elements precisely, create responsive designs, and control the visual hierarchy of the content.

## JavaScript
JavaScript: JavaScript allowed me to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page, such as validating form input, controlling scrolling, and managing user interactions. This can make the page more engaging and user-friendly, as well as improve the performance and functionality of the website.

## Summary
Overall, these tools helped me to build a high-quality and professional-looking landing page that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience. They also allowed me to work more efficiently, reduce errors, and collaborate more effectively with other team members.

By exploring my projects, you'll see my passion for coding and my dedication to continuous learning. I hope it inspires you as much as it motivates me to keep growing as a developer.
